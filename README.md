# Predicting Text Data

## 1/ Get the dataset
Look through the `prediction_dataset.ipynb` notebook to see how to get the Amazon data.<br>
You can then generate a pickle file which you use in the other notebooks.

## 2/ Predict spelling errors
The `Predicting spelling errors.ipynb` notebook has the code to try and find spelling errors in the Amazon data.

## 3/ Predict grammar errors
The `Predicting grammar errors.ipynb` notebook has all the steps needed to see whether a sentence contains any grammatical errors.

## 4/ Predict paraphrases
The final notebook, `Predicting paraphrases.ipynb` shows how to predict whether some of the sentences are paraphrases off eachother.
